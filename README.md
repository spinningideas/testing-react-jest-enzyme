# Testing React JS via Jest and Enzyme

## Jest

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity. It can be installed with npm or Yarn. Jest falls under a category of utility known as test runners that works with React applications and also works outside of React applications.

## Enzyme

Enzyme is a library that is used to test React applications. Itâ€™s designed to test components, and it makes it possible to write assertions that simulate actions that confirm whether the UI is working correctly.

Jest and Enzyme complement each other.
